This folder contains the code developed for a book library engine.

The library engine allows you to load books into the library (using csv files) and perform operations on the book data sets. The library engine 
includes the following management features:

1. Add books to the library
2. Remove books based on title or author
3. Search for individual books
4. Group books based on title or author
5. Display the contents of the library

This was an interesting project and I had a lot of fun! During its development I focused mainly on the modularity and documentation of the code as
these were the skills I wanted to improve.
